# AMLS-Coursework

This gituhub contains both python files used to obtain the results in my report. One contains everything used for task A and the other everything used for task B.

The task A file includes the code to download and process the data and implements, KNN, random forests and SVM. In it there is also a section of code that allows PCA to be used. It is up to the person running the code to decide whether or not to comment this section out in order to obtain the relevant results. The code will run exactly the same way with or without the PCA section commented out.

The Task B file includes the downloading of the data and implementing the SVM.

The packages required are:

numpy

pandas

sklearn
